FacebookClient
==============

#### Install:
Add following to Podfile (Currently not submitted to public PodSpec repo however if there's a demand I could):
```ruby
pod 'FacebookClient', '~> 0.0.1'
```

#### Usage:
```objective-c
#import <FacebookClient/FacebookClient.h>
```

Start by subclassing FacebookClient.h and use it to contain all of your custom graph API requests.
